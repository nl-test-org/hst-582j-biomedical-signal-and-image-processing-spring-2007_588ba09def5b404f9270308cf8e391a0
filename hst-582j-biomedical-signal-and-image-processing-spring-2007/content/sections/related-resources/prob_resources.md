Below are several Web sites that have interactive tutorials and applets to help in various aspects of probability covered in class.

*   [Rensselaer Continuous Random Variables](http://www.ibiblio.org/links/applets/appindex/prob1.html) - Good general information about uniform, normal, and exponential distributions. Contains several applets involving PDFs and CDFs.
*   [Rensselaer Conditional Probability](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/conditional-probability-bayes-theorem/) - Overview of conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem, but some of the applets do not always work.
*   [CSUSB Probability and Statistics Java Demos](http://www.math.csusb.edu/faculty/stanton/home.html) - Good for calculating normally distributed probabilities but limited theory. Central limit theorem.
*   [Central Limit Theorem Applet](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v6n3/applets/CLT.html) - Central limit theorem.
*   [NSF Probability by Surprise](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~susan/surprise/) - National Science Foundation site that has some nice applets, but lacking in theory and explanation. Good to check out, but not as a starting point.
