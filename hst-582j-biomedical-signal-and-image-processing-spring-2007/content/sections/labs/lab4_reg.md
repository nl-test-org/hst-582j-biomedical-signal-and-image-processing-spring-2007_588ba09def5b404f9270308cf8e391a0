description: Laboratory assignment to investigate the behavior of several objective
  functions on various 2D images in a rigid-motions scenario (translation and rotation
  only), by way of probing the objective functions. The project culminates in an experiment
  concerning the automated registration of MRI and CT (optionally PET)in 2D.
